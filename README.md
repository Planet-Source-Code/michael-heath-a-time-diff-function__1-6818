## A Time Diff Function


</div>

### Description

This is two functions with example of how to get the difference between two times by hour and min.

Code is pretty good to keep a running time of how long you've been doing something without the major offset that timers give. There are some drawbacks to this code, since it is only a small example, you probably can't check anything past 11 hrs and 59 min. Anyway, I hope this inspires some better Ideas. Enjoy the code.
